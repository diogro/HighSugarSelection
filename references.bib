  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
              new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast
              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x
              faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
              BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
              Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream
              analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source
              SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = "Next generation sequencing (NGS) is about to revolutionize
              genetic analysis. Currently NGS techniques are mainly used to
              sequence individual genomes. Due to the high sequence coverage
              required, the costs for population-scale analyses are still too
              high to allow an extension to nonmodel organisms. Here, we show
              that NGS of pools of individuals is often more effective in SNP
              discovery and provides more accurate allele frequency estimates,
              even when taking sequencing errors into account. We modify the
              population genetic estimators Tajima's $\pi$ and Watterson's to
              obtain unbiased estimates from NGS pooling data. Given the same
              sequencing effort, the resulting estimators often show a better
              performance than those obtained from individual sequencing.
              Although our analysis also shows that NGS of pools of individuals
              will not be preferable under all circumstances, it provides a
              cost-effective approach to estimate allele frequencies on a
