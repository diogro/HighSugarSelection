# Introduction

Changes underlying evolutionary response to a new environment can differ depending on the genetic architecture of the traits under selection. For traits with simple genetic architectures, controled by few genes, we would expect to see selective sweeps, in which a positively selected allele rapidly goes to fixation and leaves a detectable signature in the surrounding genomic regions. Interest in finding the causal allele responsible for a phenotype has caused a bias for this type of selective response in the literature, and we have cataloged a number of examples of positively selected genes in humans and other species. In contrast, for traits that are controled by many genes, quantitave genetic theory predicts that selection response is generated by more subtle changes across the allele frequency of many loci, and indeed many argue that this is a much more prevalent form of selection response than sweeps. If much of the selection response for complex traits is due to polygenic shifts rather than selective sweeps, the long list of sweep-like selection signatures that have been reported to date might represent the exception rather than the rule. 

Additionally, there is more to genetic architecture other than number of genes affecting a trait. Gene by gene and gene by environment interactions both contribute to genetic variation, and can presumably be leveraged in responding to natural selection. The extend to which epistasis is important for polygenic resonse is still an open question, but more recent focus on multivariate traits and responses has provided a large number of possible ways for epistatic interaction to contribute to evolutionary response.

 We argue that under fitness epistasis, selection should result in two observable patterns: 1) a correlation between the allele frequencies at interacting loci - changes in allele frequency at one locus is accompanied by corresponding changes at the interacting locus; 2) the emergence of gametic ratio distortions (GRD) in adapted populations, as unfavorable allelic combinations are selected for or against, resulting in deviations from Mendelian proportions between pairs of unlinked loci [REF]. 


Evolve and resequence (E&R) experiments are a natural and powerful for investigating these questions. In particular, we employ a type of selection that can described as natural selection in the lab. By exposing populations to a stressful enviroment and keeping them in this environment for several generations, without any sort of phenotype tracking or artifitial selection, we are effectively letting natural selection take over and tracking the resulting changes in genetic composition of the control and selected populations. One consequence of this is that the control flies are also under natural selection due to lab conditions, so it is imperative to also keep control populations throught the experiment, modifying only the stressor in the selected conditions. This allows us to separate the genomic effects of the stressor from the effects of the general lab environment. We track changes in allele frequency using PoolSeq at select generations along the experiment, combined with deeper sequencing at the beggining and at the end of the experiment to track changes in gametic disequilibrium, which can be indicative of selective sweeps and epistatic interactions.

Here, we performed an E&R experiment where three replicate populations of Drosophila Melanogaster were exposed to a stressful environment in the form of a high level of dietary sugar, while another three replicate populations were maintained on a control diet. All six populations were derived from the same base population. Whole genome sequencing was performed on flies from all six populations at generations 1, 11, 25, and 100, giving a total of almost 3000 sequenced individuals. Using this time series genomic data, we identify two directions of allele frequency change. The largest driver was shared across selected and control populations, suggesting a shared lab environment selection. The 
second largest driver of genetic change contrasts control and selected populations, and so is linked to the selection regime. We estimate that at least 6% of the genome was under positive selection due to high sugar stress. Most observed changes in allele frequency are however relatively modest, and using the individual sequence data to estimate haplotypes, we show how most of the selected loci do not show archetypical signals of selective sweeps after 100 generations. These results point towards a highly polygenic selection response, in line with theoretical expectations from quantitative genetics theory. We also quantify correlations in allele frequency between pairs of selected loci over time, as well as GRD after 100 generations of adaptation, and show that several allele show correlations and GRD across unlinked loci, suggesting that epistatic interactions participated in the response to selection. We confirn this last point by using Wright-Fisher simulations, showing that the correlations and the GRD we observe are unlikely to appear in the absense of epistatic interactions. While we lack a clear phenotype to directly study the effect of epistatic variation on selection resonse, our results suggest that epistatic contributions to polygenic response to selection are common and lead to detectable genomic signatures.

# Methods


# Results


# Discussion

Clear polygenic response, in several replicas. We only look at loci that respond consistently across replicas. Why are there so many consistent loci? Is the consistency aided by epistatic interactions that are contigent on the initial allele frequency?
